# WordTracker

Tracking changes in word use through comparison of reference and web corpora.

Step 1 `extractPlainText.sh`: Extract texts from BNC XML files, with date of publication (where available), text class (written/spoken, academic/discussion/fiction/etc), and document title. Requires XSL files `justTheWords.xsl` (BNC distribution) and `metadata.xsl` (self-authored).
